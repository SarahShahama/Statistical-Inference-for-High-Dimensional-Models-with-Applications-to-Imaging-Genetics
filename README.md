# Statistical-Inference-for-High-Dimensional-Models-with-Applications-to-Imaging-Genetics
Statistical inference framework for high-dimensional models with applications in imaging genetics. Demonstrates methods like LASSO, Elastic Net, and Knockoff Filter for identifying genetic‚Äìimaging associations.

üìÑ Overview

This project presents a conceptual and methodological framework for performing statistical inference in high-dimensional models, with a specific focus on imaging‚Äìgenetics applications. The goal is to explore how genetic variations influence brain imaging features and to establish a structured approach to identifying these associations using modern statistical tools.

Due to the computational complexity of high-dimensional datasets, this project primarily demonstrates the conceptual workflow and analytical design rather than executing large-scale computations. The framework serves as a foundation for future implementation and validation on real imaging‚Äìgenetics data.

üß© Objectives

Develop a statistical inference pipeline suitable for high-dimensional biological data.

Explore how imaging features and genetic traits may be interrelated.

Demonstrate the use of penalized regression and variable selection methods (e.g., LASSO, Elastic Net, Knockoff Filter).

Establish a reproducible R-based framework for future large-scale data analysis.

üî¨ Methodology

Data Simulation:
Simulated high-dimensional datasets mimicking genetic (SNP) and imaging features were created to study statistical inference techniques under controlled conditions.

Exploratory Analysis:
Conceptual steps for understanding data distributions, correlations, and variable dependencies were outlined. Visualization and summary techniques were suggested for understanding data structure.

Modeling Approaches:

Univariate Association Tests: Evaluate the relationship between individual predictors and response variables.

Regularized Regression Models (LASSO, Elastic Net): Handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.

Knockoff Filter: Provide statistically rigorous variable selection with false discovery rate (FDR) control.

Performance Evaluation:
Metrics such as variable selection accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false discovery control were conceptually discussed to assess model reliability.

üìä Expected Results

Although full-scale analysis was not executed due to computational constraints, the proposed framework outlines how these methods would function in practice:

LASSO and Elastic Net would identify sparse sets of influential predictors.

Knockoff Filter would yield robust and reproducible variable selection with controlled FDR.

The combined framework offers a balance between interpretability and statistical rigor, crucial for biomedical inference.

üîÆ Future Work

Implement the full workflow using high-performance computing resources.

Apply the methods to real-world imaging‚Äìgenetics datasets (e.g., UK Biobank, ADNI).

Extend the model to multivariate and Bayesian inference approaches.

Integrate biological validation of identified SNPs and imaging features.

Explore deep learning‚Äìbased inference for nonlinear patterns.
